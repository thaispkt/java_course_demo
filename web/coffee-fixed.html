            Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of berries from the Coffea
            plant. <br>
            The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and
            Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and Réunion in the Indian Ocean. <br>
            The plant was exported from Africa to countries around the world. <br>
            Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas,
            Southeast Asia, India, and Africa. <br>
            The two most commonly grown are arabica and robusta. <br>
            Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. <br>
            Dried coffee seeds (referred to as beans) are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor.
            <br>
            Roasted beans are ground and brewed with near-boiling water to produce coffee as a beverage. <br>
